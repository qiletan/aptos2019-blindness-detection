# aptos2019-blindness-detection



## What to try:

1. should use 242 img size as thats what densenet use
2. resize all imgs to 480 X 640 as thats the majority of the test images
3. other preprocessing should follow the resize


## What worked:

1. 











## What did not work:

1. five crop at 255 (got kappa around 85% in validation but did poorly in test. only 2%!)
